minimalist game
people are represented by blocks
its about reverse racism sorta
you're an oppressed white block who rises against the black blocks
maybe it shows people bashing on white people
make sure its not whiney
make sure in the context of the story its powerful or whatever
also make it about school shooting
its just a dream sequence or something
its really about individuality and trying to make everyone the same as you

if you do something, likle overlap with them, they start talking to you, and if you shoot them, they run away.
It's almost like a circle jerk, so when you get to the part with all the different colors its a contrast of ideas and opinions.

a segment where the player goes through a boring section where they all say the same thing

maybe the player types in a bunch of things they like and dont like
they'll say they don't like it and when they get shot, they just say things like, yeah same, mee too and whatnot, just generic things

IN THE COLOR LEVEL all the shapes will have actual opinions
